# choco

choco is a templating engine that lets you write HTML templates in pure, unadultered [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/).

It's a branch of [CoffeeMugg](https://github.com/jaekwon/CoffeeMugg), a branch of [CoffeeKup](https://github.com/mauricemach/coffeekup).

## Why choco?

CoffeeKup breaks closures. CoffeeMugg requires some semi-clunky code to extend the language.

## Test

choco uses mocha for testing.

```
$ npm install
$ mocha
```

## Thanks

[jaekwon](https://github.com/jaekwon), for CoffeeMugg.
[mauricemach](https://github.com/mauricemach), for CoffeeKup.

Don't kill me, both.
